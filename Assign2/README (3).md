Solution:

In Aissignment 2 of Web Design and User Experience Engineering class I have used CSS external file for my styling and design. I have used HTML and HTML5 tags respectively. I have also used column layout structure for my professional portfolio website.

I have used header, footer, body, main and div tags. Also I have used p, ul, li tags for respective content. I have hyperlinked my website with my current and previous work website. I have also linked my website with my current and previous educational institution.

I have created below webpages:
1. Home(Index page)
2. Contact page
3. professionalportfoliostyles (CSS page)

In my contact details I have used mailto and tel tags for email and calls. In my home page I have created a gallery for my certificates.

My website is responsive to media queries, the content and images get resized according to the viewing device display ratio.

I have used two column structure for my website with clean design and professioanl font. I have the UI simple and easy to understand.
