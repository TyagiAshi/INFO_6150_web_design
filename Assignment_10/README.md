# ASSIGNMENT 10
### Project aspects:
1. Built a weather forecasting application using REACT

2. Display a 5-day weather forecast, showing high and low temperatures daily and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. Use fake, hard-coded data until youâ€™ve got everything rendering correctly.

3. Add the ability to click on a day and see its hourly forecast. You can maintain the current view in the top-level App state.

4. Add React Router to the project (npm install react-router) and add routes such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.

5. Sign up for a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/

6. Fetch a real 5-day forecast, and feed that data into your app.

### Setup:

- Download the Weather app from Assignment 10 folder and type command first command "npm install" which will install all the dependencies and then run "npm run start" in terminal which will run the (app.js) react file.
