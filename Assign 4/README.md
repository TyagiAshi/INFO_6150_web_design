Web Design and User Experience Engineering Assignmnet 4:

Problem Statement:

1.	Add validations for the form for all the fields.
a.	Not null
b.	Min length
c.	Max length
d.	Fields with alphanumeric should not accept special characters.

2.	Submit button should be disabled until all validations on the fields are passed.

3.	Use regex to validate phone number, email and zip code.

4.	Validation should show a red color text along with each field and disappear on correcting particular field.

5.	Validation should be on the key events NOT at the end when submit button is pressed.

6.	Create a single select list box which has 5 elements.

7.	Write an onChange event for the created list which adds checkbox that changes dynamically for each selection.

8.	If the checkbox is enabled, add a text field and make it mandatory and on disabling checkbox, text field should disappear.

9.	On submit, create a html table which takes all the data from the previously submitted form and display results.

10.	On submit, make sure all the form fields get cleared out

11.	Add validation for email address (restrict the domain to @northeastern.edu)

12.	Street address 2 is not a mandatory field, on submit click if the field is blank then its value in the table should be blank as well.

13.	Assignment must be submitted on your PRIVATE GitHub account (use Northeastern email account) and zip file must be submitted on CANVAS and GitHub URL of assignment in the canvas remarks.


Solution:
I have used a external Js file for assignment 4. I have used form and table tags in HTML file and also put validations for each entities. First name, last name, Email id, Phone number, street address 1, street address 2, city, state, zipcode have validations.

I have addded a drop down menu for Drinks menu. We can choose drinks between hot black tea, cold coffee, lemon iced tea, expresso and latte. After chosing any one of the item from drop down menu. We can select an extra large item for $1 and after selecting the extra large option we can add additional customization for required order by commenting in the box.

I have also added a comment box for any comments related to the order. Also when we click on submit but required validations work and if all the validations are satisfied than the information in the form get submitted in a feeback table below. We can also add a blank cell for street address 2 which is not mandatory.

Thank you.
